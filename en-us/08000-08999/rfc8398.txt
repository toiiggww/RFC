1.  Introduction

   [RFC5280] defines the rfc822Name subjectAltName name type for
   representing email addresses as described in [RFC5321].  The syntax
   of rfc822Name is restricted to a subset of US-ASCII characters and
   thus can't be used to represent internationalized email addresses
   [RFC6531].  This document defines a new otherName variant to
   represent internationalized email addresses.  In addition this
   document requires all email address domains in X.509 certificates to
   conform to IDNA2008 [RFC5890].

2.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The formal syntax uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   [RFC5234] notation.

3.  Name Definitions

   The GeneralName structure is defined in [RFC5280] and supports many
   different name forms including otherName for extensibility.  This
   section specifies the SmtpUTF8Mailbox name form of otherName so that
   internationalized email addresses can appear in the subjectAltName of
   a certificate, the issuerAltName of a certificate, or anywhere else
   that GeneralName is used.

   id-on-SmtpUTF8Mailbox OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-on 9 }

   SmtpUTF8Mailbox ::= UTF8String (SIZE (1..MAX))
   -- SmtpUTF8Mailbox conforms to Mailbox as specified
   -- in Section 3.3 of RFC 6531.

   When the subjectAltName (or issuerAltName) extension contains an
   internationalized email address with a non-ASCII local-part, the
   address MUST be stored in the SmtpUTF8Mailbox name form of otherName.
   The format of SmtpUTF8Mailbox is defined as the ABNF rule
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  SmtpUTF8Mailbox is a modified version of the
   internationalized Mailbox that was defined in Section 3.3 of
   [RFC6531], which was derived from Mailbox as defined in Section 4.1.2
   of [RFC5321].  [RFC6531] defines the following ABNF rules for Mailbox
   whose parts are modified for internationalization: <Local-part>,
   <Dot-string>, <Quoted-string>, <QcontentSMTP>, <Domain>, and <Atom>.
   In particular, <Local-part> was updated to also support UTF8-non-
   ascii.  UTF8-non-ascii was described by Section 3.1 of [RFC6532].
   Also, domain was extended to support U-labels, as defined in
   [RFC5890].

   This document further refines internationalized Mailbox ABNF rules as
   described in [RFC6531] and calls this SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  In
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox, labels that include non-ASCII characters MUST be
   stored in U-label (rather than A-label) form [RFC5890].  This
   restriction removes the need to determine which label encoding, A- or
   U-label, is present in the domain.  As per Section 2.3.2.1 of
   [RFC5890], U-labels are encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629] in Normalization
   Form C and other properties specified there.  In SmtpUTF8Mailbox,
   domain labels that solely use ASCII characters (meaning neither A-
   nor U-labels) SHALL use NR-LDH restrictions as specified by
   Section 2.3.1 of [RFC5890] and SHALL be restricted to lowercase
   letters.  NR-LDH stands for "Non-Reserved Letters Digits Hyphen" and
   is the set of LDH labels that do not have "--" characters in the
   third and forth character position, which excludes "tagged domain
   names" such as A-labels.  Consistent with the treatment of rfc822Name
   in [RFC5280], SmtpUTF8Mailbox is an envelope <Mailbox> and has no

   phrase (such as a common name) before it, has no comment (text
   surrounded in parentheses) after it, and is not surrounded by "<" and
   ">" characters.

   Due to name constraint compatibility reasons described in Section 6,
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName MUST NOT be used unless the local-part
   of the email address contains non-ASCII characters.  When the local-
   part is ASCII, rfc822Name subjectAltName MUST be used instead of
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox.  This is compatible with legacy software that
   supports only rfc822Name (and not SmtpUTF8Mailbox).  The appropriate
   usage of rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox is summarized in Table 1
   below.

   SmtpUTF8Mailbox is encoded as UTF8String.  The UTF8String encoding
   MUST NOT contain a Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) [RFC3629] to aid consistency
   across implementations, particularly for comparison.

    +-----------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
    | local-part char | domain char | domain label |  subjectAltName |
    +-----------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+
    |    ASCII-only   |  ASCII-only | NR-LDH label |    rfc822Name   |
    |    non-ASCII    |  ASCII-only | NR-LDH label | SmtpUTF8Mailbox |
    |    ASCII-only   |  non-ASCII  |   A-label    |    rfc822Name   |
    |    non-ASCII    |  non-ASCII  |   U-label    | SmtpUTF8Mailbox |
    +-----------------+-------------+--------------+-----------------+

           Non-ASCII may additionally include ASCII characters.

4.  IDNA2008

   To facilitate comparison between email addresses, all email address
   domains in X.509 certificates MUST conform to IDNA2008 [RFC5890] (and
   avoid any "mappings" mentioned in that document).  Use of
   non-conforming email address domains introduces the possibility of
   conversion errors between alternate forms.  This applies to
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox and rfc822Name in subjectAltName, issuerAltName, and
   anywhere else that these are used.

5.  Matching of Internationalized Email Addresses in X.509 Certificates

   In equivalence comparison with SmtpUTF8Mailbox, there may be some
   setup work on one or both inputs depending on whether the input is
   already in comparison form.  Comparing SmtpUTF8Mailboxes consists of
   a domain part step and a local-part step.  The comparison form for
   local-parts is always UTF-8.  The comparison form for domain parts
   depends on context.  While some contexts such as certificate path

RFC 8398        I18N Mail Addresses in X.509 Certificates       May 2018


   validation in [RFC5280] specify transforming domain to A-label
   (Sections 7.2 and 7.5 in [RFC5280] as updated by [RFC8399]), this
   document recommends transforming to UTF-8 U-label instead.  This
   reduces the likelihood of errors by reducing conversions as more
   implementations natively support U-label domains.

   Comparison of two SmtpUTF8Mailboxes is straightforward with no setup
   work needed.  They are considered equivalent if there is an exact
   octet-for-octet match.  Comparison with email addresses such as
   internationalized email address or rfc822Name requires additional
   setup steps for domain part and local-part.  The initial preparation
   for the email addresses is to remove any phrases, comments, and "<"
   or ">" characters.  This document calls for comparison of domain
   labels that include non-ASCII characters to be transformed to
   U-labels if not already in that form.  The first step is to detect
   use of the A-label by using Section 5.1 of [RFC5891].  Next, if
   necessary, transform any A-labels (US-ASCII) to U-labels (Unicode) as
   specified in Section 5.2 of [RFC5891].  Finally, if necessary,
   convert the Unicode to UTF-8 as specified in Section 3 of [RFC3629].
   For ASCII NR-LDH labels, uppercase letters are converted to lowercase
   letters.  In setup for SmtpUTF8Mailbox, the email address local-part
   MUST conform to the requirements of [RFC6530] and [RFC6531],
   including being a string in UTF-8 form.  In particular, the local-
   part MUST NOT be transformed in any way, such as by doing case
   folding or normalization of any kind.  The <Local-part> part of an
   internationalized email address is already in UTF-8.  For rfc822Name,
   the local-part, which is IA5String (ASCII), trivially maps to UTF-8
   without change.  Once setup is complete, they are again compared
   octet for octet.

   To summarize non-normatively, the comparison steps, including setup,
   are:

   1.  If the domain contains A-labels, transform them to U-labels.

   2.  If the domain contains ASCII NR-LDH labels, lowercase them.

   3.  Compare strings octet for octet for equivalence.

   This specification expressly does not define any wildcard characters,
   and SmtpUTF8Mailbox comparison implementations MUST NOT interpret any
   characters as wildcards.  Instead, to specify multiple email
   addresses through SmtpUTF8Mailbox, the certificate MUST use multiple
   subjectAltNames or issuerAltNames to explicitly carry any additional
   email addresses.

6.  Name Constraints in Path Validation

   This section updates Section 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280] to extend
   rfc822Name name constraints to SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltNames.
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox-aware path validators will apply name constraint
   comparison to the subject distinguished name and both forms of
   subject alternative names rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox.

   Both rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox subject alternative names
   represent the same underlying email address namespace.  Since legacy
   CAs constrained to issue certificates for a specific set of domains
   would lack corresponding UTF-8 constraints, [RFC8399] updates,
   modifies, and extends rfc822Name name constraints defined in
   [RFC5280] to cover SmtpUTF8Mailbox subject alternative names.  This
   ensures that the introduction of SmtpUTF8Mailbox does not violate
   existing name constraints.  Since it is not valid to include
   non-ASCII UTF-8 characters in the local-part of rfc822Name name
   constraints, and since name constraints that include a local-part are
   rarely, if at all, used in practice, name constraints updated in
   [RFC8399] allow the forms that represent all addresses at a host or
   all mailboxes in a domain and deprecates rfc822Name name constraints
   that represent a particular mailbox.  That is, rfc822Name constraints
   with a local-part SHOULD NOT be used.

   Constraint comparison with SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName starts with
   the setup steps defined by Section 5.  Setup converts the inputs of
   the comparison (which is one of a subject distinguished name, an
   rfc822Name, or an SmtpUTF8Mailbox subjectAltName, and one of an
   rfc822Name name constraint) to constraint comparison form.  For an
   rfc822Name name constraint, this will convert any domain A-labels to
   U-labels.  For both the name constraint and the subject, this will
   lowercase any domain NR-LDH labels.  Strip the local-part and "@"
   separator from each rfc822Name and SmtpUTF8Mailbox, leaving just the
   domain part.  After setup, this follows the comparison steps defined
   in Section 4.2.1.10 of [RFC5280] as follows.  If the resulting name
   constraint domain starts with a "." character, then for the name
   constraint to match, a suffix of the resulting subject alternative
   name domain MUST match the name constraint (including the leading
   ".") octet for octet.  If the resulting name constraint domain does
   not start with a "." character, then for the name constraint to
   match, the entire resulting subject alternative name domain MUST
   match the name constraint octet for octet.

   Certificate Authorities that wish to issue CA certificates with email
   address name constraints MUST use rfc822Name subject alternative
   names only.  These MUST be IDNA2008-conformant names with no mappings
   and with non-ASCII domains encoded in A-labels only.
